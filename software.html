            <h2>What is Software Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Software engineering is a field of engineering & writing programs for computers. A software engineer writes softwares and compiles software using methods that proves it. Software Engineering process is model chosen for managing creation of software from initial-scale
                to final product. It is a process of developing software in a planned and structured way.

                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>The classic waterfall model is a linear SDLC model where each phase is completed before moving to the next. 
                    It follows a sequential flow: requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.
                     While simple to understand and manage, it can be inflexible, making it difficult to accommodate changes during development.</p>

                <h3>Iterative Waterfall Model is a hybrid approach that combines the sequential nature of the classic Waterfall model with the flexibility of iterative development. 
                    It divides the project into smaller, manageable iterations, each following the Waterfall phases (requirements, design, coding, testing). 
                    After each iteration, FEEDBACK is incorporated into the subsequent ones, allowing for adjustments and improvements based on early results. 
                    This provides more flexibility and adaptability compared to the traditional Waterfall model.</h3>

                <h4>High-Level Design: The system is broken down into smaller components or modules.</h4>
                <h4>Low-Level Design: Detailed designs for each component are created.</h4>
                <h4>Coding: The actual coding of the software begins.</h4>
                <h4>Unit Testing: Individual components or modules are tested to ensure they function correctly.</h4>
                <h4>Integration Testing: Multiple components are integrated and tested together.</h4>
                <h4>System Testing: The entire system is tested to verify that it meets the specified requirements.</h4>
                <h4>Acceptance Testing: The software is tested by the end-users to ensure it meets their needs.</h4>
