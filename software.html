            <h2>What is Software Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Software engineering is a field of engineering & writing programs for computers. A software engineer writes softwares and compiles software using methods that proves it. Software Engineering process is model chosen for managing creation of software from initial-scale
                to final product. It is a process of developing software in a planned and structured way.

                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>The classic waterfall model is a linear SDLC model where each phase is completed before moving to the next. 
                    It follows a sequential flow: requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.
                     While simple to understand and manage, it can be inflexible, making it difficult to accommodate changes during development.</p>

                <h3>Iterative Waterfall Model is a hybrid approach that combines the sequential nature of the classic Waterfall model with the flexibility of iterative development.

                    After each iteration, FEEDBACK is incorporated into the subsequent ones, allowing for adjustments and improvements based on early results. 
                    This provides more flexibility and adaptability compared to the traditional Waterfall model.</h3>

                <h4>Low-Level Design: Detailed designs for each component are created.</h4>
                <h4>Coding: The actual coding of the software begins.</h4>
                <h4>Unit Testing: Individual components or modules are tested to ensure they function correctly.</h4>
                <h4>Integration Testing: Multiple components are integrated and tested together.</h4>
                <h4>System Testing: The entire system is tested to verify that it meets the specified requirements.</h4>
                <h4>Acceptance Testing: The software is tested by the end-users to ensure it meets their needs.</h4>

                     with the product. This feedback is then used to refine and improve the prototype until it meets the desired requirements.</h3>

                <h3>Scrum is a popular Agile framework used for managing complex projects, especially in software development.
                     It emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.</h3>
                <p>Here's a breakdown of the Spiral Model:</p>
                    <h4>Sprints: These are time-boxed iterations, typically 2-4 weeks long, during which a specific set of features or tasks are completed.</h4>
                    <h4>Product Backlog: This is a prioritized list of all the features or functionalities that need to be developed for the product.</h4>
                    <h4>Sprint Backlog: This is a subset of the Product Backlog that is selected for development during a specific Sprint.</h4>
                    <h4>Daily Scrum: This is a daily 15-minute meeting where the team discusses their progress, identifies impediments, and plans for the next day.</h4>
                    <h4> Sprint Review: This is a meeting at the end of each Sprint where the team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback.</h4>
                    <h4>Sprint Retrospective: This is a meeting at the end of each Sprint where the team reflects on their performance and identifies areas for improvement.</h4>
                <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <p>Advantages include ...</p>
                <p>1)Freedom</p>
                <p>2)High Product Quality & Low Risk</p>
                <p>3)Reduced development time</p>
                <p>4)Review current sprint & go to next</p>
                
                <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                <p>Disadvantages include ...</p>
                <p>1)Not efficient for big teams</p>
                <p>2)No changes can be done once sprint done</p>
